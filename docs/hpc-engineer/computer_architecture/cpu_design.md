# CPU Design

## Overview
CPU design involves creating the architecture and microarchitecture of a central processing unit. It includes defining the instruction set, designing the control unit, and optimizing the data path.

## Key Components
- **Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)**: Defines the set of instructions that the CPU can execute.
- **Control Unit**: Manages the execution of instructions by directing the operation of the other components.
- **Data Path**: The hardware that performs the actual data processing operations.

## Example: Simple CPU Design
Here is an example of a simple CPU design using a hypothetical assembly language.

### Assembly Code
```assembly
LOAD R1, 1000  ; Load the value at memory address 1000 into register R1
ADD R1, R2     ; Add the value in register R2 to the value in register R1
STORE R1, 1001 ; Store the result from register R1 into memory address 1001
```

### Explanation
`LOAD`: Loads a value from memory into a register.
`ADD`: Adds the values of two registers.
`STORE`: Stores a value from a register into memory.
