# Introduction to Computer Architecture

## Overview
Computer architecture refers to the design and organization of a computer's core components, including the CPU, memory, and input/output systems. It defines the system's functionality, performance, and scalability.

## Key Concepts
- **CPU (Central Processing Unit)**: The brain of the computer that performs instructions defined by software.
- **Memory Hierarchy**: The organization of different types of memory (e.g., cache, RAM, disk) to optimize performance.
- **I/O Systems**: Interfaces and devices that allow the computer to communicate with the external environment.

## Example: Basic CPU Design
Here is an example of a simple CPU design using a hypothetical assembly language.

### Assembly Code
```assembly
LOAD R1, 1000  ; Load the value at memory address 1000 into register R1
ADD R1, R2     ; Add the value in register R2 to the value in register R1
STORE R1, 1001 ; Store the result from register R1 into memory address 1001
```

### Explanation
`LOAD`: Loads a value from memory into a register.
`ADD`: Adds the values of two registers.
`STORE`: Stores a value from a register into memory.
