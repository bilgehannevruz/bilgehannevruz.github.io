## Overview
Job scheduling is the process of allocating system resources to various tasks in a way that optimizes performance and efficiency. It is a critical component in operating systems, high-performance computing, and cloud environments.

## Key Concepts
- **Batch Scheduling**: Jobs are collected into batches and executed sequentially.
- **Real-Time Scheduling**: Jobs are scheduled to meet specific timing constraints.
- **Priority Scheduling**: Jobs are assigned priorities, and higher-priority jobs are executed first.
- **Fair Scheduling**: Ensures that all jobs get a fair share of resources.

## Example: Simple Batch Scheduler
Here is an example of a simple batch scheduler using a queue.

### Pseudocode
```pseudocode
queue = []

function add_job(job):
    queue.append(job)

function run_jobs():
    while queue is not empty:
        job = queue.pop(0)
        execute(job)
```
