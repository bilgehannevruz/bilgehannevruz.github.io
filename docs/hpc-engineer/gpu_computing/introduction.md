## Overview
GPU computing involves using a graphics processing unit (GPU) together with a CPU to accelerate scientific, engineering, and enterprise applications. GPUs are highly efficient at performing parallel computations, making them ideal for tasks such as simulations, deep learning, and data analysis.

## Key Concepts
- **Parallelism**: The ability to perform multiple computations simultaneously.
- **CUDA**: A parallel computing platform and API model created by NVIDIA.
- **OpenCL**: An open standard for parallel programming of heterogeneous systems.

## Benefits
- **Performance**: GPUs can significantly accelerate computational tasks.
- **Efficiency**: GPUs are optimized for parallel processing, making them more efficient for certain types of computations.
- **Scalability**: GPU computing can be scaled across multiple GPUs and nodes.

## Example: Matrix Multiplication
Here is an example of how GPU computing can be used to perform matrix multiplication.

### Pseudocode
```pseudocode
for each row i in matrix A:
    for each column j in matrix B:
        for each element k in row i of A and column j of B:
            C[i][j] += A[i][k] * B[k][j]
```

### Explanation
- **Matrix A**: The first input matrix.
- **Matrix B**: The second input matrix.
- **Matrix C**: The result matrix.
