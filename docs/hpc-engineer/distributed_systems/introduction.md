# Introduction to Distributed Systems

## Overview
Distributed systems consist of multiple independent computers that appear to the users as a single coherent system. These systems work together to achieve a common goal, providing benefits such as scalability, fault tolerance, and resource sharing.

## Key Concepts
- **Scalability**: The ability to handle increased load by adding more resources.
- **Fault Tolerance**: The ability to continue operating despite failures.
- **Consistency**: Ensuring that all nodes see the same data at the same time.
- **Latency**: The time it takes for a message to travel from one node to another.

## Example: Distributed Database
Here is an example of a distributed database system where data is replicated across multiple nodes.

### Pseudocode
```pseudocode
if write request:
    write data to primary node
    replicate data to secondary nodes
else if read request:
    read data from nearest node
```

Explanation
Write Request: Data is written to the primary node and then replicated to secondary nodes.
Read Request: Data is read from the nearest node to minimize latency.
