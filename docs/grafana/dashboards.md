# Grafana Dashboards

## Overview
Grafana dashboards are customizable panels that display data from various sources. They provide a visual representation of your metrics, allowing you to monitor and analyze your data in real-time.

## Key Features
- **Panels**: Individual visualizations within a dashboard, such as graphs, tables, and gauges.
- **Variables**: Dynamic values that can be used in queries to create interactive dashboards.
- **Annotations**: Notes and events that can be added to graphs to provide context.
