# Real-Time Scheduling

## Overview
Real-time scheduling is a method of job scheduling where jobs are scheduled to meet specific timing constraints. This approach is commonly used in systems where timely execution is critical, such as in embedded systems, robotics, and multimedia applications.

## Key Features
- **Timing Constraints**: Jobs have specific deadlines or periods within which they must be executed.
- **Deterministic Behavior**: The system's behavior is predictable and consistent.
- **Priority Levels**: Jobs are assigned priorities based on their timing requirements.

## Example: Real-Time Scheduler
Here is an example of a simple real-time scheduler using priority queues.

### Pseudocode
```pseudocode
priority_queue = []

function add_job(job, priority):
    priority_queue.push(job, priority)

function run_jobs():
    while priority_queue is not empty:
        job = priority_queue.pop()
        execute(job)
