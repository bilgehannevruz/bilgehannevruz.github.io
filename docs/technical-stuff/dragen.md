This page states how HRD enriched samples should be noted in a samplesheet:


| Sample Parameter | Required | Details                                                                    |
|------------------|----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Sample_Feature  | No       | *Only required for HRD enriched samples. For DNA samples that have undergone HRD enrichment, enter HRD in this column of the sample sheet. If the sample has not undergone HRD enrichment, leave the field empty.*|
